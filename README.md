Unsupervised Machine Learning for Customer Segmentation
Now we will build K-mean unsupervised machine learning algorithm in Scikit Learn to perform customer segmentation. In this hands-on project, we will complete the following tasks:

Task 1: Understand the problem statement and business case
Task 2: Import libraries and datasets
Task 3: Visualize and explore datasets
Task 4: Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm
Task 5: Learn how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
Task 6: Use Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method
Task 7: Apply k-means using Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation
Task 8: Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization
While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
